# StarOcean3InventionCalculator
An invention calculator for Star Ocean 3, originally created by Aerius. 

This is an invention calculator currently stored at http://pendell.atspace.cc/so3ic.html
The game mechanics are such that, when you choose three inventors and choose to create an original invention, you 
are presented with the price of an invention attempt but you are NOT told what that invention actually is, or how 
difficult it is to create.  For example, let us say you want to invent the boots of prowess. It isn't fun to blindly
guess whether a price of 15 indicates you are inventing the object, or a price of 5000. What's more, if the cost is 
high, it is useful to know whether your chosen inventors have a prayer of actually creating the item, or whether you 
are going to flush thousands of gil down the drain and have nothing to show for it. Further, not all inventors can
invent all objects. Puffy, for example, is the only compounding inventor who can create the Molotov Stun Bomb-R1. 

This calculator is intended to 
take the guesswork out of the process.  So, if you are seeking a specific invention, this will allow you to choose
the inventors most likely to create it, and what prices it will be cost to create it. This allows you to simply skip
over unwanted objects which would otherwise consume time, gil, and inventory space.
